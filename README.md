# GwaliorTourGuide
An application named GWALIOR TOURISM to provide information about the local attractions of the city Gwalior (in Madhya Pradesh, India) to the tourists.

We built an application named GWALIOR TOURISM to provide information
about the local attractions to the tourists. Our software comprises of 5
modules integrated together in our application but working independently.
We developed our application using Android Studio, MySQL and Java. The
basic purpose of the application is to provide information about the tourist
places and various hotels and eating joints nearby. We have tried to provide a 
platform to users where they can search their desired locations inside the city 
and also review the places they visit. The modules contain the information about 
tourist places, major attractions, hotels, restaurants, and nearby attractions are 
defined and their database is stored and accessed via MySQL.
